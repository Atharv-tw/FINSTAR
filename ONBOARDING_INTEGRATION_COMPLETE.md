## 🔗 Integration Points

### Current Status (Mock Data)

Both screens currently use **mock data** for demonstration:
- Welcome screen has hardcoded quiz questions
- Result screen shows mock "Prudent Saver" personality
- No API calls yet

### Next Step: Connect to API

**To make it fully functional, you need to:**

1. **Create API Service** (`lib/services/onboarding_service.dart`):
```dart
class OnboardingService {
  final String baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/api/v1';

  Future<OnboardingQuiz> getQuiz(String token) async {
    // GET /onboarding/quiz
  }

  Future<OnboardingResult> submitQuiz(
    String token,
    List<QuizResponse> responses,
  ) async {
    // POST /onboarding/submit
  }

  Future<OnboardingStatus> getStatus(String token) async {
    // GET /onboarding/status
  }
}
```

2. **Update Welcome Screen:**
   - Fetch quiz from API instead of mock
   - Handle loading states
   - Show error messages if API fails

3. **Update Result Screen:**
   - Call API to submit quiz responses
   - Display actual calculated personality
   - Show real XP/coin rewards
   - Update user profile state
